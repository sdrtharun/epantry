this is the epantry project for school
E-Pantry Project
 
About the project:
We the students of grade XII, plan to create a project for our school canteen management. This project is about creating individual prepaid accounts for each and every person who uses the canteen. There will be no involvement of physical cash. Parents can recharge their wards account online and can set daily expenditure limitations including account history. Each user will have a unique qr code to access their account in canteen.

Aim of the projects:
	To make digital canteen and avoid physical cash.
	Avoid the necessity to carry cash to buy in canteen.
	Make all transactions easily accessible to the admin for business calculations.
	Avoid loss or theft of money in school.
Plan of execution:
This project can be achieved through a responsive website or an application. A website is the most easily accessible and easy to implement the payment gateways like paytm, debit or credit cards. User interface can be designed by using HTML and CSS. For the backend of the website we plan to use  MYSQL as the database structure for storing individual account details and a popular web development framework called DJANGO in python for its functionality. We will use the help of our computer teachers and our robotics sir in case we get stuck or need help to resolve an issue.
Requirements:
	A domain name like epantry.in or epantry.shop etc.
	A hosting service to host the website externally.
	A CPU at the canteen for scanning the unique  code and updating the database after transaction.
Team Members:
	Bharath
	Tharun
	Ramesh kannan
	Viswa
	Mohamed Farhaan
	Muthu Priya Thavasi
